Hello!

My project is the beginnings of the redesign of the front end of my company's website. I used a case study approach to target needs and wants in updating our site --to make it faster loading, more responsive, and available to users on mobile devices and screen sizes. Once I met with people within the company, I built a wireframe for the site and sent it off for approval and refinement. After that, I was able to meet with our current web developer to discuss features that would be implemented on the back end. Although this is a work in progress, the clean, straightforward yet modern design is indicative of where we want our site to be in the near future.

Built using Foundation 6 and Slick Image Carousel
